## The Titanic Dataset

we will use R packages to explore the Titanic dataset and visualize key patterns and insights, abd their relations to the survival rate of the passengers. 

You can download the the titanic dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset 


### LOADING NECESSARY PACKAGES:
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse) 
```


### LOADING THE DATASET:
```{r dataset}
titanic_ds <- (titanic) 
```

### #EXPLORING AND CLEANING THE DATASET:
```{r libraries}
#To view data in a spreadsheet-like format 
View(titanic_ds)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
